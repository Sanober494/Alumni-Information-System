# Alumni-Information-System
Every school has network of Alumni who were once part of school and are now placed well in their lives. Alumni of a school generally stay in touch with their immediate friends but find it hard to stay connected with other school mates. Contact between alumni can be used to gain insight in a new field, career counseling or guidance. The project Alumni Information System which allows get together old students and new students of a school to communicate with each other. The main purpose of this project is to provides all the detail about Alumni, School, School Mates, Social Network, Opportunity, School News, Student. In this system students to know information about each other and their current activities. The New students can ask about career, subject details with old students who has completed his studies. Students who had completed his studies and begin his professional carrier can be helpful for other students and schools for providing guidelines for new students, so this project Alumni Information System will help school and students to be in contact with alumni. So keeping these things in views, we have computerized a project work “ALUMI INFORMATION SYSTEM” using Python-MySQL where lots of user-friendly form of controls have been added to create an interactive user application. It provides an easy way to maintain records. :)✨
